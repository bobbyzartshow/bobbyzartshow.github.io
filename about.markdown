Hi, I'm Robert Zunigha. I'm an artist and technology enthusiast with a keen interest in AI.

My background spans fine arts, digital media, and customer service, and I'm currently transitioning into AI development. I love exploring the intersection of creativity and technology, finding new ways to express artistic vision through emerging tech.

On this blog, I'll be sharing my journey, my projects, and my thoughts on the evolving landscape of art and AI. Whether you're an artist, a tech enthusiast, or just curious about the future of creativity, I hope you'll find something interesting here.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
